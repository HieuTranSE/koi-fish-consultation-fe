          Caring for koi fish is more than just maintaining a pond; it is about
          creating an environment that harmonizes with the principles of Feng
          Shui. Koi fish, as symbols of prosperity, resilience, and harmony,

          <h2 style={styles.subtitle}>1. Maintain Clean and Balanced Water</h2>
          <p style={styles.text}>
            In Feng Shui, water symbolizes wealth and abundance. Keeping the
            pond water clean and balanced is crucial for attracting and
            maintaining positive energy. Ensure that the water is clear and free
            of debris by using effective filtration systems and performing
            regular water changes. Monitor pH levels and ammonia c ontent to
            create a healthy environment for koi, as poor water quality can
            disrupt the energy flow and negatively impact the fish’s health.

          <ul style={styles.list}>
            <li>Use a reliable filtration system to maintain water clarity.</li>

              Test pH levels and adjust if necessary to keep them balanced.

          <h2 style={styles.subtitle}>2. Proper Feeding for Vibrant Health</h2>
          <p style={styles.text}>
            Koi fish symbolize abundance, and their health reflects the energy
            of your space. Feed your koi a balanced diet rich in nutrients to
            maintain their vibrant colors and vitality. Avoid overfeeding, as
            excess food can pollute the water and create negative energy.
            Feeding koi during the warmer months and reducing their intake as
            the temperature drops helps align with natural energy cycles,
            maintaining harmony within the pond environment.

          <ul style={styles.list}>
            <li>
              Feed high-quality koi food to enhance their colors and health.

            <li>
              Adjust feeding quantities based on water temperature and koi
              activity levels.

            <li>Remove uneaten food to prevent water contamination.</li>
            <li>
              Reduce feeding during colder months to align with natural energy
              flow.

            3. Positioning the Koi Pond for Optimal Energy Flow
          </h2>
          <p style={styles.text}>
            The location of your koi pond plays a significant role in Feng Shui.
            Ideally, the pond should be situated in the southeast area of your
            garden or home, which is associated with wealth and prosperity.
            Ensure the water flows toward the house to invite wealth and
            abundance. Avoid placing the pond in direct alignment with doors or
            windows, as this can cause energy to escape quickly, diminishing its
            positive effects.
          </p>
          <ul style={styles.list}>
            <li>
              Position the pond in the southeast corner for maximum prosperity.
            </li>
            <li>Direct water flow toward the home to attract wealth.</li>
            <li>
              Avoid placing the pond directly in line with doors or windows.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use curves and natural shapes to promote a smooth energy flow.

            4. Incorporate Aquatic Plants for Balance
          </h2>
          <p style={styles.text}>
            Aquatic plants not only enhance the beauty of the koi pond but also
            play a role in balancing the environment according to Feng Shui.
            They provide shade, oxygenate the water, and create natural
            filtration, ensuring a harmonious and balanced ecosystem. Plants
            like water lilies and lotus are especially auspicious, as they
            symbolize purity and spiritual growth, enhancing the positive energy
            of your koi pond.
          </p>
          <ul style={styles.list}>
            <li>
              Add plants like water lilies and lotus for aesthetic and spiritual
              benefits.

          </h2>
          <p style={styles.text}>
            Seasonal changes affect the energy within a koi pond. Adapting care
            routines based on the season helps maintain positive Feng Shui
            energy year-round. In spring, thoroughly clean the pond and inspect
            equipment. During summer, monitor oxygen levels and water
            temperature. Prepare for winter by reducing feeding and ensuring
            there’s a way for gases to escape. Regularly adapting maintenance
            routines ensures continuous flow and harmony.

            6. Enhance the Pond with Koi-Friendly Decorations
          </h2>
          <p style={styles.text}>
            Decorations such as rocks, statues, or fountains can enhance the
            Feng Shui energy of the pond. Choose natural elements that blend
            with the surroundings to create a harmonious atmosphere. Statues of
            dragons or turtles can also be used, as they are considered
            protectors of wealth and bringers of luck in Feng Shui. Ensure
            decorations are placed thoughtfully to avoid obstructing the koi’s
            movement, as free movement symbolizes unobstructed prosperity.

              movement.

            7. Monitor Koi Health for Prosperity Alignment
          </h2>
          <p style={styles.text}>
            The health of your koi directly reflects the prosperity energy in
            your space. Healthy, vibrant koi represent flourishing and abundant
            energy, while sick or stressed koi indicate imbalances. Regularly
            observe their behavior, monitor for signs of illness, and take
            immediate action if necessary. A well-maintained koi pond not only
            boosts Feng Shui energy but also ensures that the koi remain a
            positive symbol of wealth and growth.
