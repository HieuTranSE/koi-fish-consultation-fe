            1. Koi Fish Paintings in the Living Room
          </h2>
          <p style={styles.text}>
            The living room is often the central area for gathering and energy
            flow in a home. Hanging a koi fish painting here can enhance the
            flow of <strong>prosperity and harmony</strong>. The image of koi
            swimming upstream can symbolize ambition, while calm, peaceful koi
            can create a relaxing and balanced atmosphere. Make sure the
            painting is placed facing inward to invite wealth and opportunities
            into your home.

          <h2 style={styles.subtitle}>2. Koi Fish in the Entryway</h2>
          <p style={styles.text}>
            The entryway of a home is crucial in Feng Shui as it is the point
            where energy enters. Placing a koi fish statue or artwork near the
            entryway is believed to attract <strong>wealth and success</strong>{" "}
            as it symbolizes the energy of abundance. It can also act as a
            guardian, ensuring that only positive energies enter your space. A
            pair of koi fish is ideal for this area, representing harmony and
            protection.

          <h2 style={styles.subtitle}>3. Koi Fish Pond in the Garden</h2>
          <p style={styles.text}>
            If you have an outdoor space, creating a koi pond in the garden can
            be a powerful Feng Shui enhancer. Water represents{" "}
            <strong>wealth and abundance</strong>, and a pond with koi fish
            amplifies this energy. The movement of the koi fish in the water
            symbolizes the continuous flow of prosperity. Ideally, place the
            pond in the southeast corner of your garden, which is traditionally
            associated with wealth in Feng Shui.
